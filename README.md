I wrote a script to scrape data from a website called Fatabyyano. Using some headers, I make it look like a regular browser visit. The script goes through 20 pages of articles, grabbing titles, publication times, categories, and links.

For each article, it dives into the content, extracting text from specific sections like blockquotes and divs. It also collects any source links mentioned in the articles.

Finally, it dumps all this data into a CSV file named "1-Fatabayano.csv", neatly organized into columns. That's about it. Clean and simple.
